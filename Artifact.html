                <div class="fact-text">Indian people loved fine arts and indulged in dancing, sculpting and painting. This is revealed through the artefacts discovered by archaeologists and seeing them historians interpret some valuable facts about the lifestyle in ancient India.

                    These artefacts come to us right since the Indus valley civilization that belonged to Chalcolithic or Copper Age that's followed by the Iron Age during the Vedic period.

                  <p>The "Balochistan Pot" (3500BC-2800BC) is made of terracotta. It was found in Mehrgarh, a Neolithic site in Balochistan province in what is now Pakistan.

                    Like other vessels found in the region, it is painted in multiple colours - a technique known as polychromy that was common in ancient cultures. The pottery reveals a knowledge of pigments derived from various metal oxides.
                    
                    These pots were used for cooking and storage but also served a ceremonial purpose since they were found in graves as well.</p>

                  <p>The humped bull with gold horns (1800BC) is from the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, which thrived in parts of northern India and Pakistan.

                    The bull was discovered in the north Indian state of Haryana. The gold horns were also common in west Asia, while the agate was quarried in western India. </p>

                  <p>This inscription on basalt rock (250BC) carries the edicts of Emperor Ashoka, who ruled one of the largest empires in ancient India, including most of modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

                    Ashoka was believed to have renounced war and violence in favour of a more peaceful path. He spread his philosophy through inscriptions, which were put up across the Mauryan empire. The above fragment is from the ancient port of Sopara near Mumbai.</p>

                  <p>The Kushans ruled most of northern India and parts of central Asia in the first century AD. It likely belonged to a large statue originally.

                    Many of these sculptures were found near Mathura, a town in northern India that was the capital of the Kushan empire.</p>

                  <p>The bronze Buddha (AD900-AD1000) comes from a port town in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

                    The town was a major centre of production for Buddhist imagery during the Chola dynasty, which ruled large parts of the country's south.
                    
                    The flame on top of the Buddha's head is symbolic of his wisdom. The iconography of the flame influenced images of the Buddha in Sri Lanka and South East Asia.</p>
